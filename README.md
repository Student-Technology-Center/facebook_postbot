# Getting Page Access Token and ID

## 0. Create Facebook App

Go to My Apps.
Click "+ Add a New App".
Setup a website app.
You don't need to change its permissions or anything. You just need an app that won't go away before you're done with your access token.

--------------------------------------

## 1. Get User Short-Lived Access Token

Go to the Graph API Explorer.
Select the application you want to get the access token for (in the "Application" drop-down menu, not the "My Apps" menu).
Click "Get Token" > "Get User Access Token".
In the pop-up, under the "Extended Permissions" tab, check "manage_pages".
Click "Get Access Token".
Grant access from a Facebook account that has access to manage the target page. Note that if this user loses access the final, never-expiring access token will likely stop working.
The token that appears in the "Access Token" field is your short-lived access token.
 
---------------------------------- 
 
## 2. Generate Long-Lived Access Token

Following these instructions from the Facebook docs, make a GET request to

https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/oauth/access_token?grant_type=fb_exchange_token&client_id={app_id}&client_secret={app_secret}&fb_exchange_token={short_lived_token}
entering in your app's ID and secret and the short-lived token generated in the previous step.

You can also use the Graph API explorer to do this. first replace "me?fields=id,name" with "oauth/access_token" into the field to the left of the Submit button, then simply toggle POST under the GET dropdown to the left of that, and add these four fields:
* grant_type fb_exchange_token
* client_id {app_id}
* client_secret {app_secret}
* fb_exchange_token {short_lived_token}

The response should look like this:

{"access_token":"ABC123","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":5183791}
"ABC123" will be your long-lived access token. You can put it into the Access Token Debugger to verify. Under "Expires" it should have something like "2 months".

----------------------------------

## 3. Get User ID

Using the long-lived access token, make a GET request to

https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/me?access_token={long_lived_access_token}
The id field is your account ID. You'll need it for the next step.

----------------------------------

## 4. Get Permanent Page Access Token

Make a GET request to

https://graph.facebook.com/v2.10/{account_id}/accounts?access_token={long_lived_access_token}

The JSON response should have a data field under which is an array of items the user has access to. Find the item for the page you want the permanent access token from. The access_token field should have your permanent access token. Copy it and test it in the Access Token Debugger. Under "Expires" it should say "Never".
